## 1. Project Title

"Welcome to Crashy Bird"

## 2. Team

Joseluis Alamo Marquez Jr.
Samantha Gonzalez

## 3. Project Objective

We converted the Microbit game of Crashy Bird to Python and added a welcoming display and a score function that works with the B button input. 

## 4. Research

We used youtube source:

## 5. Design
Input:
A button was used for flapping our bird
B button was used for showing the score
reset button used to rest the game


## 6. Development
Microbit Crashy Bird Game that was converted to Java, then converted to Python
Youtube sources

## 7. Testing

Flapping the bird kept leading to errors and we would keep downloading the game and tried multiple times. We kept changing our functions and erasing code, getting lost to the point we searched "How to not get out of the led screen, when making a microbit game". This then led us to youtube, which is where we found the function that works. After this we just personalized our own speed in pipes and bird flapping. 

## 8. Demo

The game worked perfectly in class. The flapping was too fast, so we took this in mind and decreased the speed in pipes from 0 to 2. 

## 9. Summary

We first started out the project with hopes to make something work with bluetooth. But, the microbit app didn't have a music option for ios. We were planning on using the input buttons a and b to change music from our playlist, but that is only possible with the android version of the app. So instead, we converted the Microbit game of Crashy Bird to Python and added a welcoming display and a score function that works with the B button input. The pipes themselves where created using the built in image function from microbit.org, with the same process as the RPSS game, except the leds are made lighter by being lighted by 5 instead of 9. We then had to control the speed of the pipes by putting them into a function, which is where we got into problems and the bird either got stuck or kept getting out of the led screen in our microbit. So, after multiple tries of downloading the game we headed to google to find out how to not crash the bird out of the game. This then led us to youtube, which is where we found the function that works. After this we just personalized our own speed in pipes and bird flapping.
