# CPE micro:bit Term Project

Term project for students in the CPE 1040 course at MSUD, Fall 2018.

## Assignment

Design and implement some application of the [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) educational computer. It can be a new design of your own or an already existing design from the Web.

### Language requirement

The implementation has to be in [MicroPython](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (the version of Python that works on the micro:bit). 

**Note:** It is perfectly acceptable to take a project implemented in JavaScript/Blocks and rewrite it in MicroPython.

## Submission

### 1. Github

Fork and clone this directory and submit the URL of your fork (remote) on [Canvas](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1397722/assignments/10046266?module_item_id=20700270).

### 2. Individual

You can collaborate with one or two team mates on the design, implementation, and testing of the project, but you have to have *your own* separate Github repository and make an *individual* submission on Canvas.

### 3. Due date

**Sun, Dec 2, 2018, by 23:59**

**Note:** You can submit your URL at any time before the deadline on Canvas. Only your latest commit on Github earlier than the deadline will be evaluated.

### 4. Project report

Write the project report in your README using the template provided below. 

**Note:** Projects without reports will receive **0 points** for the whole project.

### 5. Project demo

The project has to be demonstrated by the team in the lab period on **Wed, Nov 28**. Presentation slides are *optional* but will be noted in the evaluation of your submission. If you can't make this date, you can demo at any *earlier* date, but no later dates.

**Note:** The demo is **not optional**. If a project is not demonstrated, the grade will be at the discretion of the instructor.

## Grading

The project is worth a total of 600 points. Breakdown:

| Criterion | Points |
| --- |:---:|
| Functionality of application | 300 |
| Good use of [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) capabilities | 100 |
| Input and output | 50 |
| Complexity of the application | 50 |
| Quality of demo | 50 |
| Clarity of report | 50 |

# Project Report

Fill out this template in place in the README of your own fork of the assignment repository. Put any supporting materials (diagrams, schematics, pictures, presentation slides, etc) in the [assets](assets) folder. You can reference them from this report. For example, [todo file](assets/todo.md). Use this [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to format the report.
